# How to Ace the Behavioral Interview

If you haven't found your true calling yet do not worry. Here's some material to get you started in your job hunt. This post contains a collection of general questions that are likely to come up during interviews and how you can use them to your advantage. It is divided into three sections: I) You, II) The company and the work, III) Questions. Technical questions might also be asked but we do not address them here.

It is arrogant not to do your homework first. You need to show respect in a way that demonstrates understanding for your work and the company. Do careful preparation in advance and learn everything you can about the company. You must plan your presentation thoroughly, in every detail. You must make your presentation smooth and fluent, answering each of the interviewer's questions or concerns. A professional presentation significantly lowers fear and skepticism and raises trust and credibility. Study proper conduct and dress for the business, organization or individual whom you will be confronting.

When you take the time to learn about the company's work, purpose and performance, you will bond with them. Your interviewers will enjoy and feel confident working with you in the future. As the adage goes: *"They donâ€™t care how much you know until they know how much you care."*

## I) You
### 1. Background
As an introduction, learn to narrate a different version of your CV and career path. Who are you? Where / what did you study and why? What were your most important career decisions? Present yourself as a self-effacing, intelligent, hard-working, conscientious and driven person whom the team can trust and who fits into company culture. Now let the company representative do the same about him- / herself.

Your goal should be to lead an ongoing conversation with your interviewers. Frame your answers carefully and purposefully, in everything you do. You had better answer fast. Speed matters!
### 2. Strengths and Weaknesses
Make a list of your strengths and weaknesses (ask others for help). Think about examples of how and where your strengths have helped you do well. Next, jot down areas for improvement. Describe yourself with 3-4 adjectives.
### 3. Exceptional Achievements
A fair question to gauge your level of experience is to ask about your favorite projects where you exceeded your own or others' expectations. Expect questions on team size, conflicts/resolution, what challenges you faced, how you overcame them, what you would do differently in hindsight, etc. You also need to talk about a time when you took initiative to change or contribute in an important way.
### 4. Hobbies
The human is more than his professional accolades. To get to know you better you might be asked to elaborate on your extracurricular activities. Enthusiastically explain what you do in your free time and that those activities make you more productive, creative, lead a healthier lifestyle and expand your horizons. Be able to give examples of extraordinary achievements as well, e.g a leadership role you took up in a student club or a teaching assistantship for course X at your university.
### 5. Future Plans
Another traditional question to ask is what your mid-term and long-term goals are. The more that you look upon the potential job as an opportunity to perform well and then move ahead, the better you will do the job from day one and the more prepared you will appear during the interview.
## II) The company and the work
### 0. Aptitide Test
Some companies like to evaluate a person's intellect and confidence. To this end they refer to online tests before the actual in-person interview. Do these sincerely and you will start off on the right foot.
### 1. Investigate your industry
Your motivation to work for the company you have applied to must be crisp and clear - it should light a fire in you. You should also have a convincing reason on why you are planning on leaving your current company. Sample reasons are career advancement, career change, attractive company portfolio and higher exposure.

Read books published by experts in the field. Explore problems. Stay updated on current events and social trends. Find work that challenges you, pushes your limits and is aligned with your ambitions and priorities.
### 2. Interests
Sometimes you might not be a good fit for the role you are applying to. However, you still get interviewed because your profile managed to impress or there are other openings which would suit you. Thus, you will be asked in greater detail about your preferences. Share your project portfolio and let your interviewers know what you bring to the table and how you will add value to your coworkers and customers. 
### 3. Language Test
If you have to relocate to take up a certain position you should expect a language test. This refers to answering a number of questions in the respective language. Also: Why do you want to relocate (not enough jobs in your area, great offer, family obligations, etc.)?
### 4. Project
If the project has not already been described by the project leader (e.g. through a Powerpoint presentation) drill him with questions: Which problem would you work on (if offer is accepted)? Will you receive supervision? Why did they pick you as potential candidate for this job? Also be prepared for the question on how *you* would improve the relevant product or service the company offers. The more you can demonstrate genuine interest and knowledge about how the product or service, the more powerful an impact you will have.
### 5. Environment
You might be the hardest worker but if you end up in a toxic work environment you won't achieve anything but attrition. As for the employer, he won't get any benefit from hiring you if he doesn't provide you with the environment you need to thrive. Thus, a common question asked during interviews is how your ideal environment looks like and what your expectations are from your future leader and boss (e.g. authentic, can listen, is inclusive and respectful).
### 6. Team
In most jobs team work is crucial. Thus, you will be questioned on this one as follows: How important is team work for you? What is your favourite role in a team?

Team work helps to progress faster and reduce errors by learning from each other and double-checking each other's work. It also gives you a break from your isolation. Mostly, people do enjoy taking up a certain role / are good at something specific. Sometimes it's even good to be different. It adds diversity to the company.


## III) Questions
Almost all interviews end with a round of questions where the candidate gets the chance to clarify doubts and ask further questions. Avail the opportunity to finish strong! Ask lots of questions. Be patient. The questions should demonstrate a passion for your work and, depending on the job, the skills that are necessary to succeed in that role. Here are some examples:
### 1. What major challenges does the job entail? 
Make sure you have prepared your own list of possible options before.
### 2. What is the mode of operation? [for software and test engineers]
Agile, Scrum, Kanban, Lean, etc.
### 3. What is expected of me? What are my key responsibilities?
Average work day, peer reviews, review meetings, deadlines, mentorship - all these discussions go in here.
### 4. What tools and technologies are used?
You will get an overview from the job description, but it doesn't hurt to ask again and make clear where your core competencies lie and that you are willing to learn new things. Also: Do you have any special skills?
### 5. What are the working conditions like?
Work load, working hours, salary, holidays, contract (temporary, permanent, contractual) - all these discussions go in here.
### 6. How is the team structured? What is the size of the team? What are key roles?
Find out how many and what sorts of people you will be working with. It's also good to know your team lead, but most probably that's going to be one of your interviewers.
### 7. Vision, strategy and culture
I am sure you are interested in knowing what the core values are, where the company is headed and how the general atmosphere is like. Be eager to find out!
