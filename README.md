# How to Ace the Behavioral Interview

If you haven't found your true calling yet do not worry. Here's some material to get you started in your job hunt. This post contains a collection of general questions that are likely to come up during interviews and how you can use them to your advantage. It is divided into three sections: I) You, II) The company and the work, III) Questions. Technical questions might also be asked but we do not address them here.

## I) You
### 1. Background
Learn to narrate a different version of your CV and career path. Who are you? Where / what did you study and why? What / where have you worked (on) before? Now let the company representative do the same about him- / herself.
### 2. Strengths and Weaknesses
Make a list of your strengths and weaknesses (ask others for help). Think about examples of how and where your strengths have helped you do well. Next, jot down areas for improvement. Describe yourself with 3-4 adjectives.
### 3. Exceptional Achievements
A fair question to ask to get to know more about your work ethics and experience level is to ask about your pet projects (what challenges you faced, how you overcame them, what you would do differently, etc.).
### 4. Hobbies
The human is more than his professional accolades. To get to know you better you might be asked to enumerate or elaborate on your extracurricular activities. Enthusiastically explain what you do in your free time and how those activities relate to your priorities in life.
### 5. Future Plans
Another traditional question to ask is what your mid-term and long-term goals are. To answer this question accurately study career paths of people who have what you *want* or have been in your position before. Jot down your career choice and list the steps needed to get there.
## II) The company and the work
### 1. Motivation
Your motivation to work for the company you have applied to must be crisp and clear to you. Sample reasons are career advancement, company services & portfolio, more diversity and higher exposure. A better pay is not one of them, unless you are in dire need and your circumstances do not allow you an alternative option.
### 2. Interests
Sometimes you might not be a good fit for the role you are applying to. However, you still get interviewed because your profile managed to impress. Thus, you will be asked in greater detail about your preferences. Be ready to talk about them and also mention why you applied for that specific position.
### 3. Language Test
If you have to relocate to take up a certain position you should expect a language test. This refers to answering a number of questions in the respective language.
### 4. Projects
If not already described by the project leader (e.g. through a Powerpoint presentation) drill him with questions: Which problem would you work on (if offer is accepted)? What are suitable subproblems? Will you receive supervision? Why did they pick you as potential candidate for this job?

## III) Questions
### 1. Challenges
### 2. Language Test
### 3. Mode of Operation
### 4. Working Conditions


Wishing you good luck and a rewarding career!
