# How to Ace the Behavioral Interview

If you haven't found your true calling yet do not worry. Keep trying your luck until you score. You will end up with a rewarding career eventually. Here's some material to get you started in your job hunt. This post contains a collection of general questions that are likely to come up during interviews and how you can use them to your advantage. It is divided into three sections: I) You and the company, II) The work, III) Questions. Technical questions might also be asked but we do not address them here.

## You and the company
### 1. Background
Learn to narrate a different version of your CV and career path. Who are you? Where / what did you study and why? What / where have you worked (on) before? Now let the company representative do the same about him- / herself.
### 2. Strengths and Weaknesses
Make a list of your strengths and weaknesses (ask others for help). Think about examples of how and where your strengths have helped you do well. Next, jot down areas for improvement.
